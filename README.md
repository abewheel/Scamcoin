## About the Project


This repository contains the web files for Scamcoin. I wrote Scamcoin from scratch in 2018 as a fun side project.


## Technical Details


Scamcoin was implemented using standard web development technologies. Besides HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Scamcoin utilizes the jQuery library, the Bootstrap framework, and Font Awesome icons. I created the logo and coin animation myself using GIMP 2 and Paint 3D. The site is hosted using cPanel's Linux-based web hosting.
