## About the Project


This repository contains the web files and contracts for Scamcoin. I wrote Scamcoin in 2018 as a fun side project.


## Technical Details


ScamCoin is an ERC-20 compliant token built with Solidity on the Ethereum network. It utilizes OpenZeppelin to create dynamic and distributed protocols for smart contract regulation. Besides HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the Scamcoin website utilizes the jQuery library, the Bootstrap framework, and Font Awesome icons. I created the logo and coin animation myself using GIMP 2 and Paint 3D. The site is hosted using cPanel's Linux-based web hosting.
